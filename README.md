# The-Future-Value-of-Homes
Incorporates machine learning and predicts the future values of homes for the next few decades based off of previous values for the state of Maryland. Implements the use of Bayesian regression due to our dataset not being tremendously large. A model is also created for visualization. Bayesian Regression is preferred with smaller data sets such as the one I am using.
