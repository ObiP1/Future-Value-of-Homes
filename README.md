# The-Future-Value-of-Homes
Incorporates machine learning and predicts the future values of homes for the next few decades based off of previous values for the state of Maryland. Implements the use of Bayesian regression due to our dataset not being tremendously large. A model is also created for visualization.

Files Included:

1) AverageHomeValues.csv - Data table containing median price values for homes in Maryland from 1940-2020
2) Code.py - Raw python code created to obtain our model
